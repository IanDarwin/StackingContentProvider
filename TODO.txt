Todo list for Stacking Sync Provider - not yet working, alas.

Several tests fail. DemoActivity fails to insert records in Bookmarks.

If we had a notion of which CP's were "remote" handlers, 
query() could, when retrieving from a remote, insert it locally.

Maybe: limit to one local and one remote?

To handle case where id fields are not in sync:
Provide an sqlite database  mapping local _id to remote _id
for each remote?
