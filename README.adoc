== StackingContentProvider

Allows you to stack multiple content providers, eg., local SQLite and back-end REST.

This is the demonstration project for

=== HowTo

Since the Android (AOSP and Google) refuse to support Maven,
you must have the Maven Android Deployer, which repackages
your existing Android SDK into something Maven can digest.
Fear not: this is easy to get and use:

----
git clone https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer.git
(cd maven-android-sdk-deployer && mvn install -P 4.3)
----

Assuming you have Android 4.3 and the Google APIs for it;
if not, get that Android SDK Manager (Download) window running!

Then you should be able to build and test this project with Maven.
